## Knowledge tracing

### Description

Knowledge Tracing is the task of modelling student knowledge over time so that we can accurately predict how students will perform on future interactions. Improvement on this task means that resources can be suggested to students based on their individual needs, and content which is predicted to be too easy or too hard can be skipped or delayed.

## Diagnostic Questions

### Description

The answers that the students give to these questions reveal key information about the specific nature of misconceptions that the students may hold. Analyzing the massive quantities of data stemming from students’ interactions with these diagnostic questions can help us more accurately understand the students’ learning status and thus allow us to automate
learning curriculum recommendations.
